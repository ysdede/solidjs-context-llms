This repository provides a **fully indexed, deep-context documentation suite** for SolidJS, optimized specifically for LLMs and AI Agents.

## 🚀 Why this is better than a standard `llms.txt`

While `llms.txt` is great for simple websites, complex frameworks like **SolidJS** require structure. This repository functions as a **structured alternative to `llms.txt`**:

- **Deep Context**: Includes source code JSDoc, internal logic, and multi-repo knowledge (Solid Start, Solid Router, etc.).
- **Smart Indexing**: Unlike a flat text file, this repo provides a hierarchical index (`index.md` and `index.json` per domain).
- **On-Demand Loading**: AI agents can browse the index to find exactly what they need without context-window overflow.
- **JSDoc Extraction**: TypeScript types and comments are extracted into clean Markdown for better reasoning.

## 📂 Structure

- **[index.md](./index.md)**: Main entry point and high-level domain overview.
- **`core-reactivity/`**: Signals, Effects, Memos, and the fine-grained engine.
- **`routing/`**: Components and hooks from `solid-router`.
- **`ssr/`**: Server-side rendering, hydration, and `solid-start`.
- **`primitives/`**: Ecosystem helpers and standard utils.

## 🤖 How to use with AI Agents

AI agents (like Antigravity, Cursor, etc.) can be pointed to this repository to gain "Zero-Shot" expert knowledge of the SolidJS ecosystem.

**Agent prompt example:**
> "Review the structure in `index.md` and use the domain-specific `index.json` files to navigate the SolidJS primitives. Only read the files relevant to the current task."
